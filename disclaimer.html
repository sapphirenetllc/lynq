          <h2>1. Service Availability</h2>
          <p>LYNQFAST services are subject to availability in your specific location. Not all services, packages, or speed tiers may be available in all areas. Coverage maps and service descriptions on this website are approximate and for informational purposes only.</p>

          <h2>2. Speed and Performance</h2>
          <p>Advertised internet speeds represent maximum potential speeds under optimal conditions. Actual speeds experienced by customers may vary based on multiple factors including but not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Time of day and network congestion</li>
            <li>Distance from service equipment</li>
            <li>Quality and age of in-home wiring</li>
            <li>Customer equipment (routers, modems, devices)</li>
            <li>Number of connected devices</li>
            <li>Type of content or applications being accessed</li>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>4. Service Interruptions</h2>
          <p>While LYNQFAST strives to provide reliable, continuous service, interruptions may occur due to:</p>

            <li>Scheduled maintenance and upgrades</li>
            <li>Weather events and natural disasters</li>
            <li>Power outages</li>
            <li>Equipment failures</li>
            <li>Factors beyond LYNQFAST's control</li>
